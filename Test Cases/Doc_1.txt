Along with the degradation of labor, Gandhi believes that capitalism imbues greediness in every human being. The introduction of machinery makes man a limitless consumer of commodities leading to the multiplication of wants and desires. This further leads to unhealthy competition which ultimately results in violence. Therefore, he believes that violence is inherently embedded in the western civilization which promotes capitalism and hence considers capitalism to be immoral, driven only by comforts and bodily welfare.
