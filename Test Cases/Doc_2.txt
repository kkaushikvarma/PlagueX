Gandhi’s principles are a staunch critique of the western models of capitalism. According to him, India’s real strength lies in its cultural roots and traditions and India should not let go of those roots in an attempt to conform to the norms of a ‘modern civilization’. He believes that India’s superiority lies in its resistance to change and thus rejects capitalism as capitalism transforms everything it touches.
