The statuette of the Dancing Girl is a beautiful piece of art preserved over centuries. The young girl stands very confidently with one hand on her hip and legs slightly bent. She has a serene and undisturbed expression on her face, gently smiling and fully engrossed in whatever she is doing. Her coiled hair, bangles and necklace show us the ideals of beauty people aspired to at that time. The figure shows us that art and dance were important and deep-rooted parts of the Harappan culture. It displays the broad mentality of that period when people knew how to portray nakedness in women as an art and not relating it to explicit sexuality. It is sculpted with very fine detail suggesting that the Harappan’s were very competent sculptors.
