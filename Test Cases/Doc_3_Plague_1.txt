The strike began on May 29, and on June 1 the manufacturers met publicly to plan their response. They had two strategies. They pressured the proprietors into holding out indefinitely by refusing to send new collars and cuffs to any laundry, and they attempted to undermine directly the union’s efforts to weather the strike. They also tried to create a negative image of the union through the newspapers, which they virtually controlled. Under these circumstances, the collar ironers’ tactics were much less useful.
