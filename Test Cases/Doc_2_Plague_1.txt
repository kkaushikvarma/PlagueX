Gandhi's ideals firmly criticise the West's models of capitalism. He belives that its cultural roots and traditions are India's biggest strengths and they should not be let go off in order to adjust to the principles of a 'modern civilization'. According to him, India's power lies in opposition to change and therefore he dismisses capitalism as capitalism changes everything it comes in contact with.
