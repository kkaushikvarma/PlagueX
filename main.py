SampleText = "Ever since Plato, in his book, ‘The Republic’, defined art as an imitation of reality, several definitions of art were proposed throughout history that explained art in terms of its representational, expressive, and formal properties. These definitions, along with new forms of art that came to surface, split the discussion on defining art into essentialist, and non-essentialist approaches. What is it that makes it so important for art to have a definition in the first place? A definition states the necessary and sufficient properties of a term/concept/object that is being defined. A definition is highly essential for something like art as it allows us to understand its essence and uniqueness which would, in turn, enable us to respond to it appropriately and construct a scale to measure why one work of art is better than the other. Although, it is extremely difficult to identify the necessary and sufficient properties for a concept as vast and variable as art, I believe it is nevertheless reasonable to attempt to define it and it is the same that I intend to do in this paper: attempt to define art. I shall evaluate the essentialist and non-essentialist definitions of art and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. I shall also argue against Weitz’s claim that art, being an open concept, cannot be defined and prove that art can, indeed, be defined. I shall end my essay by proposing a new approach to art that embodies characteristics of both essentialist and non-essentialist approaches.The first approach, non-essentialism, states that there are no necessary and sufficient conditions or properties for art and that there are only similarities and relationships. Therefore, one can describe art but not define it (Wittgenstein) (Weitz).The second approach, essentialism, on the other hand, argues that it is indeed possible for art to have a definition provided one can find the necessary and sufficient conditions for art (elements that are common to all forms of art). Over the course of this paper, I shall analyze a particular theory from each of these approaches starting with the essentialist approach.  Leo Tolstoy, in his work, “What is Art?”, takes an absolute essentialist and objective approach and in doing so disregards concepts like beauty as a criterion in defining art because something like beauty is subjective and cannot be defined objectively.  He places art as a medium of communication, just like speech, and states that the aim of art is not to offer pleasure or entertainment to the viewer. Tolstoy clearly defines art as a human activity in which one man transmits the feelings and experiences that he has lived to others allowing them to experience the feelings and experiences. Tolstoy claims that art is essential for human survival without which there would be chaos among people. Although this sounds dramatic, Tolstoy justifies his claim by saying that art communicates and evokes common emotions among people, and that it creates communities around shared feelings.   In addition to defining what art is, he also offers a scale for measuring how good or bad an artwork is. He states that the more successful an artist is in communicating and evoking emotions in his audience, the greater an artwork is. Tolstoy offers three essential elements on which the greatness of an artwork is measured upon.  First of these elements is the individuality of the artwork’s expressions. The more individual the feeling transmitted, the more strongly does it affect the viewer.  The second element is the clearness of the expression. The clearer the feeling that is transmitted, the stronger it infects the viewer. The third element which Tolstoy considers as the most important is the degree of sincerity of the artist.  Tolstoy writes that it is necessary for any object to incorporate all of these elements at least in the smallest degree in order to be considered a work of art. In reality, most artworks don’t always transmit the exact same feelings that the artist had to the audience. People usually have different interpretations and responses and it is highly unlikely for the viewer to experience the exact feelings experienced by the artist.  Having said that, we are concerned with only the definition of art i.e. whether or not an object is a work of art and not with how good or bad the artwork is. Therefore, a mere transmission of feelings from the artist to the audience with even the slightest traces of the three essential elements (Individuality, Clearness, and Sincerity) can serve as a necessary and sufficient condition for something to be called art in Tolstoy’s words.  It is quite clear that this definition of art does not take all forms of art into account. It is this failure to account for all forms of art that is the main drawback of not only Tolstoy’s definition of art but also other essentialist definitions of art. Plato’s imitation theory, for instance, states that something is art if and only if it is an imitation of reality. Similarly, the representational definition of art requires an object to represent something of the real world to be called art and the formalist definition of art requires an object to satisfy a set of formal conditions to be called art. Although each of these theories succeeded in constructing a logically correct definition for what art is by proposing certain necessary and sufficient conditions, they failed to consider the ever-changing nature of art and therefore could not account for all forms of art across all periods of history. Unlike the essentialist approach which required a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, the non-essentialist approach does not require a condition that all objects that come under art should satisfy. From a non-essentialist perspective, all or some combination of certain properties together would be sufficient for something to be called as Art. Denis Dutton, in his article, “The Naturalist Definition of Art”, offers a theory from this standpoint. 	Over the next few sections of this paper, I shall evaluate Dutton’s “cluster definition” of art and examine if it fails or succeeds in defining the word, art.  It is important to note that the anti-essentialist approach doesn’t actually define art but merely describes it. In addition to that, it is logically impossible for a term to have a definition without necessary and sufficient conditions (Tittle 199).  By this logic, Dutton’s “Naturalist Definition of Art” is, in fact, not a definition but a description of art. I shall nevertheless make an attempt to define art by using Dutton’s properties. Dutton’s cluster theory consists of twelve properties none of which are either necessary or sufficient for something to be called an artwork. Instead, these properties are factors that can be used collectively to call something a work of art. These twelve properties can briefly be described as the following: Direct Pleasure: In Dutton’s words, an art object is valued as a source of immediate experiential pleasure in itself. He says “the enjoyment of artistic beauty often derives from multilayered yet distinguishable pleasures that are experienced either simultaneously or in close proximity to each other” (Dutton 369). For example, in a movie, the background music, the plot, and the visuals form multiple layers that are presented together for the enjoyment of the audience. Skill and Virtuosity: The creation of any object or performance “requires and demonstrates the exercise of specialized skills” (Dutton 369). For instance, a good voice for a singer. Style: Works of art are mad  in recognizable styles and follow certain rules that govern form, composition, or expression.  Novelty and Creativity: Dutton claims that “novelty, creativity, originality and capacity to surprise its audience” are highly valued in art and that they are important in acquiring attention to an artwork, which is a major component of its entertainment value (Dutton 370). Criticism: Dutton argues that artistic forms often exist along some kind of critical language of judgment and appreciation (Dutton 370). Representation: Dutton writes that “art objects, including sculptures, paintings, and oral and written narratives, and sometimes even music, represent or imitate real and imaginary experiences of the world” (Dutton 371). This representation can make the viewer experience pleasure as it appeals to one’s emotions by offering them a different perspective of the object/concept the artwork represents.  Special Focus: Dutton says that certain factors like “A gold-curtained stage, a plinth, spotlights, ornate picture frames, illuminated showcases, book jackets and typography” can contribute to the appreciation of an artwork as they make it “something out of the mundane stream of experience end activity” (Dutton 371). Expressive Individuality: Although not always fully achieved, Dutton states that the potential to express individual personality is generally prevalent in artistic practices. Emotional Saturation: Dutton writes that artworks trigger certain emotions in varying degrees.Intellectual Challenge: Dutton writes that “works of art …. (are) designed to utilize a combined variety of human perceptual and intellectual capacities to a full extent” and that the exercise of these mental capacities itself is a “source of aesthetic pleasure” (Dutton 371). Art Traditions and Institutions: Art objects and performances are often created and given significance based on their place in the history and traditions of their art. Imaginative Experience: Dutton considers imagination to be a distinct mental activity that draws on emotion. Borrowing from Kant, Dutton writes that a “work of art is a 'presentation' offered to an imagination that appreciates it irrespective of the existence of the presented object: for Kant, works of art are imaginative objects subject to disinterested contemplation. All art, in this way, happens in a make-believe world” (Dutton 372). As I have discussed above, the major drawback with the essentialist approach is that no single definition could account for all forms of art across all periods of history and this is something Dutton’s cluster theory succeeds in doing.  The twelve properties listed above encompass all the features that an object falling into the category of art possess and I can’t possibly picture an artwork that is devoid of all these features. But the all-encompassing nature of Dutton’s theory doesn’t imply a definition. Over the next few sections of this paper, I shall address some of the properties of Dutton’s Cluster theory and examine whether they can be used to construct a logical definition.  Over the last few centuries, despite many debates, one common aspect that most definitions of art including representational, expressive and formalist definitions, agree on is that art is associated directly or indirectly with some form of emotions. In fact, many of Dutton’s properties listed above are described in terms of emotions: Emotional Saturation, Intellectual challenge, Imaginative Experience, Direct Pleasure (the emotional experience of pleasure) and Skill (How using certain colors or singing with a specific tone triggers certain emotions).  Relying (to a certain extent) on something as subjective as emotions to describe or define art can be very problematic. Firstly, we cannot identify a single specific emotion that is associated solely to art. Therefore, for art to be defined in terms of emotion, one has to identify a particular emotion that is triggered only by art.  In addition to that, the major problem in relying on emotions or, in fact, any of Dutton’s properties is that it is only a function of not anything else. Dutton himself admits that the emotions that one experiences in an artwork are “familiar in many other areas of life, such as the pleasure of sport and play, of quaffing a cold drink on a hot day” (Dutton 369). Therefore, for art to be defined in terms of emotion, one has to identify a particular emotion that is triggered only by art.  In addition to that, the major problem in relying on emotions or, in fact, any of Dutton’s properties is that it is only a function of art that is being addressed by the property but not what art essentially is. Consider the following example. The word “water” can be explained in the following ways:  Water is an entity that is utilized by living organisms to generate energy for life-support. Water is a colorless, transparent, odorless, liquid formed by the combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  It is only the latter explanation that defines water as it explains what it essentially is while the former merely states the function of water.  So, why is it that it is so easy to define something like water and not something like art? Morris Weitz, in his book, ‘The Role of Theory in Aesthetics’, answers this question. He writes that it is in the nature of art to be expanding in scope and changeable over time (Weitz 32). He argues that this nature of art makes it devoid of any essence and as a result, devoid of any fixed necessary and sufficient conditions. By this logic, a definition of art, he claims, is logically impossible.  Throughout this essay, I have analyzed the essentialist and non-essentialist theories of art in search of a valid definition for art with the logic that is presented in the standard format below. Although we arrived at the same conclusion, it is not flawed as the initial premises are different and a definition of art is possible provided one identifies this essential property. To summarize the above arguments, we have proved that art has at least one essential property and therefore proved that, it can be defined. One is required to identify this “essential property” of art in order to find a definition that we have just proven to exist. However, from my analysis of the earlier sections of this paper, one can say that it is very unlikely to find this essential property of art through either of the approaches (essentialist and non-essentialist). Therefore, it seems likely that a new approach ought to be defined in order to construct a definition for art; one that addresses the drawbacks of both essentialist and non-essentialist approaches discussed in this paper.  At this stage of the paper, I attempt to create a new approach that I have theorized above to define art; one that imbibes the encompassing nature of the non-essentialist approach and at the same time, provides a logical definition that is offered by the essentialist approach. I shall create a metaphorical scenario and use vivid imagery in order to clearly illustrate this idea.  Consider a student named, Michael, enrolled in an under-graduate program in a university. Throughout his program, Michael is required to take a certain number of courses. Towards the end of each course, Michael is tested for his proficiency in the course and is given a specific grade. If he demonstrates no form of proficiency in a specific course, he receives an “F” which indicates that he had failed in that course. Although the university requires Michael to take all the courses that are offered, it does not make it mandatory for Michael to pass in all courses or a particular course but instead requires him to pass a given number of courses of his choice by the end of the program.  If Michael fails to pass in a given number of courses, he cannot receive a degree from the university. If Michael does not receive the degree, the world wouldn’t call him a graduate. Therefore, Michael can be called a graduate if and only if he receives a degree from his university.  Michael’s university offers him a degree if and only if he passes a given number of courses. Michael can only pass a course if and only if he demonstrates proficiency in that specific course. We can derive the following statements from the list above: A degree from the university is a necessary and sufficient condition for someone to be called a graduate. Passing a certain number of courses is a necessary and sufficient condition for someone to receive a degree Demonstration of proficiency in a specific course is a necessary and sufficient condition for someone to pass that course. We can derive the following definitions from the statements listed above: Graduate: Someone who received a degree from a university. Degree: Something that is awarded for completing a certain number of courses in a university. Passing a course: A success in demonstrating proficiency in a course. As one can notice in the above scenario, all the terms have been defined logically and clearly. Applying this scenario to Dutton’s cluster theory of art would help us picture an ideal definition of art.  Let the term “student” be replaced by “object”, “Michael” be replaced by a sculpture named “David”, “course” replaced by “property”, and finally, let the term “graduate” be replaced by “art”. Just the way Michael wanted to be called a graduate, the object, David wants to be called art.  Like Michael is tested for his proficiency in a course, David, the object, is checked if it embodies certain properties. David, the object, is said to pass a property if it embodies it successfully.  For example, David passed in properties such as skill, style, and representation but failed in properties like intellectual challenge and imaginative experience.  At this point, I’d like to introduce a new term called “Artship”. Like to Michael, it is not mandatory for David, the object, to pass all the properties or a specific property and it is fine if David fails to pass certain properties. Just the way Michael received a “degree” for passing a given number of courses, David, the object, is given the “Artship” for passing a given number of properties.  After having received this “Artship”, the world considered David, the object, as “Art”, just the way the world considered Michael as a graduate. Therefore, David, the object, is considered “Art” if and only if it possesses the “Artship”  David, the object, is offered the “Artship” if and only if it passes a given number of properties. David, the object, can only pass a property if and only if it successfully embodies that property. We can derive the following statements from the list above.  “Artship” is a necessary and sufficient condition for something to be called “Art” Passing a certain number of properties is a necessary and sufficient condition for something to possess “Artship” The embodiment of a certain property is a necessary and sufficient condition for something to pass that property  We can derive the following definitions from the statements listed above. Art: an object that possesses “Artship” Artship: The characteristic of an object that passes a given number of properties.  Passing a property: The embodiment of a specific property by an object. Therefore, by introducing a middle-term, Artship, to Dutton’s cluster theory and placing a threshold on the number of properties that are required for something to be called art, I have come up with a revised definition of art. To summarize, what I have done is combined the encompassing properties put forth by the non-essentialist approach and constructed a definition for Art by evaluating these properties through conditional bridges and by introducing an essentialist property called the “Artship”."
