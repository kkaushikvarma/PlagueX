   Objectives:

    Compare two or more documents for Plagiarism in language, thoughts, ideas or expressions.
    
      1. Generate a match-score on variable query size (starting from phrase-level to document level) between two documents
      
          a . Generate a match-score between two queries:
          
              SUB GOALS:
              
              i. Process Text ................ DONE
              
              ii. Create Corpus
              
              iii. Determine weights.
              
              iv. implement a distance algorithm.
              Secondary Goals: Try to access WordNet without NLTK as it can save us a lot of computational time 
              
              
          b. Create an algorithm to grow the query size upon matching of the smallest query set
              SUB GOALS: 
              Will figure out once we've finished the previous task
              
      2. Determine the threshold match-score for the query to be classified as Plagiarised.
